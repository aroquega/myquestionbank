MyQuestionBank is a study app that lets students learn by test-taking and lets teachers create their
own tests.

Product Vision
--------------

Test-taking is one of the fastest ways of learning because it forces your to recall the information.
Instead of trying to learn by reading or looking at mental diagrams.
